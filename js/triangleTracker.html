    <h2>Types of Triangle with Respect to Sides</h2>
    <p>
      Shapes are part of our daily life and it is important to understand each
      and every shape. The most common shape we see around is the triangle. The
      shape with three corners are commonly known as the triangle but every
      three-cornered shape is not the same, and to understand this concept we
      are here to explain you with different types of triangles.

      This type of triangle consists of three equal sides and equal angles.
      Every side of the triangle is of the same length and every angle will be
      of the same measure of 60.Â°

      The triangle with only two equal sides is known as the isosceles triangle.
      Not only two equal sides, the isosceles triangle also consists of two
      equal angles
